        <p class="about-us-p">THE BEGINNING OF A JOURNEY<br><br>
            Entertainment events and youth festivals are quite popular throughout the region, providing spaces 
            for healthy recreation for young people and adults. The most popular festivals and events in San Salvador, the capital 
            of El Salvador, are those related to Japanese Animation, Manga and Video Games.<br><br>

            Fan Fest Sv was an event conceived and organized by Ingo Pytheas Forrer Nuila and a wonderful team. 
            As part of a long-term project, two different events were held: Fan Fest Halloween Party and Fan Fest Magic Day, the latter 
            with the stellar participation of one of the best anime opening and ending singers in the region, from Mexico, Cesar Franco.<br><br>

            Being quite popular events throughout the national territory, it is necessary to mention that you must be in a constant search for new 
            and better ideas to keep the attending public and attract new public. At one point there was an over saturation of entertainment events 
            with a comic and anime concept, after a while people began to stop attending due to the large number of events that took place throughout the year.<br><br>

            SECTIONS AND ORGANIZATION<br><br>

            The different sections that we presented to our public were of very varied interests. In the entertainment event we must offer multiple options to 
            our public so that they stay and participate in all the content prepared on stage and off stage, it took a long time to prepare and communicate 
            with many people who were key to the realization of the different entertainment sections.<br><br>

            The different sections offered in the first event were the following:<br><br>

            °Section of costumes and photography (Halloween Concept)<br>
            °Section of video games and video game tournaments.<br>
            °Sales and Curiosities Section.<br>
            °Food and Drinks Section.<br>
            °Section of Academic Exhibitions (Graphic Design).<br><br>
