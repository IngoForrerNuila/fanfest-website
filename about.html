                    Entertainment events and youth festivals are quite popular throughout the region, providing spaces 
                    for healthy recreation for young people and adults. The most popular festivals and events in San Salvador, the capital 
                    of El Salvador, are those related to Japanese Animation, Manga and Video Games.<br><br>

                    Fan Fest Sv was an event conceived and organized by Ingo Pytheas Forrer Nuila and a wonderful team. 
                    As part of a long-term project, two different events were held: Fan Fest Halloween Party and Fan Fest Magic Day, the latter 
                    with the stellar participation of one of the best anime opening and ending singers in the region, from Mexico, Cesar Franco.<br><br>

                    Being quite popular events throughout the national territory, it is necessary to mention that you must be in a constant search for new and better ideas to keep the attending public and attract new public. At one point there was an over saturation of entertainment events with a comic and anime concept, after a while people began to stop attending due to the large number of events that took place throughout the year.
