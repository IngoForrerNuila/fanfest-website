                    The different sections that we presented to our public were of very varied interests. In the entertainment event 
                    we must offer multiple options to our public so that they stay and participate in all the content prepared on stage 
                    and off stage, it took a long time to prepare and communicate with many people who were key to the realization of the 
                    different entertainment sections.<br><br>

                    The different sections offered in the first event were the following:<br><br>

                    °Section of costumes and photography (Halloween Concept)<br><br>
                    °Section of video games and video game tournaments.<br><br>
                    °Sales and Curiosities Section.<br><br>
                    °Food and Drinks Section.<br><br>
                    °Section of Academic Exhibitions (Graphic Design).<br><br>

                    It is very easy to read, however for all these sections to be carried out, an arduous coordination work had to be carried 
                    out between the organizers and the personnel in charge of each section. However, it was a great pleasure to see the participating 
                    public happy to be able to enjoy all this content off stage. It would be necessary then to concentrate on the realization of all the 
                    contents on stage, a question that is not easy at all but that thanks to God could be carried out with the support of all the trained sound 
                    and lighting personnel.
